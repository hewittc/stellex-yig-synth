This code was produced during a university intership and may be useful to 
someone interested in building their own Stellex YIG synthesizer controller.

For more information, see John Miles' project and documentation here:

I make no guarantee this code will work for anyone as I no longer have access
to the hardware and cannot verify that it works. Maybe somebody will find it
useful anyway.
